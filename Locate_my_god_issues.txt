Know issues in Locate My God ver 1.0.0:

->When resuming to shrine search fragment or favorite screen, sometimes queries happen to execute automatically (Generally happens in HTC Wildfire- seldom behavior)

->Not a bug though, but if google returns lat long for location, user won't be able to update unless it used Lock Location from Detail screen.

->Very seldom crashes when internet connection is too weak.
